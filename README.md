## Purpose

To create a fun and engaging 2d video game. The gameplay is meant for the player to swing through a city like a superhero as that is the theme for this year's Hackathon. It is an endless scrolling game with the goal to go as far as possible.

## Tools

The tools for the project were the Unity engine for building the application, Visual Studio code for programming, and Krita for the artwork. I also used GitHub for version control.

## Challenges

The main challenge for the game was to create a smooth player movement script. Coding the swinging mechanics was difficult and took a lot of trial and error. Eventually I got to a simple and intuitive controls for the player. Another challenge was having the level generated forever and with different variations. I had to learn from the internet to generate an infinite level with variations. Other minor challenges were fixing game-breaking bugs like a rocket creating and destroying itself for infinity that would lead to a stack overflow. Eventually I got rid of all game-ending bugs I could find. I also struggled with designing the levels as I am not good at art, but I kept it simplistic and it came out well. I also had to learn to set project goals and deadlines so I could complete the work in time.
